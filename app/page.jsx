              <h3>Physical Health</h3>
              <p className="small">Dog owners walk an average of 22 minutes more per day, leading to better cardiovascular health, lower blood pressure, and reduced risk of obesity.</p>

              <h3>Mental Wellbeing</h3>

              <h3>Community Building</h3>
